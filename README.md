# IntoTheDeep
 
To find code open: /road-runner-quickstart-master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode

(Click each folder in that order, all active code is under teamcode)

### This repo is the ENTIRE needed structure
Theoretically you should be able to download and run from any machine without any issues. 

If desired, each team member can create their own branch to store to while working and then can merch with master once code is functioning/approved/whatever.
